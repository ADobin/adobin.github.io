<h1>About Alex</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Alex Dobin.</p>

<p>
	I currently work as a software engineer manager at Microsoft on Power Apps, responsible for the
	authoring experiences for users on our platform.
</p>

<p>
	Outside of work, I enjoy exploring Washington state and riding my motorcycle. I also spend a lot
	of time with my dog, Marco.
