# Creating a blog

I have been building a [homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/introduction) for the last few years, mostly to [self-host](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/) services securely at home without relying on the major cloud providers. I've learned a lot going through the experience and wanted to start sharing some of the knowledge back to the community outside of a few tiny pull requests that I've made. Look for more coming soon!
